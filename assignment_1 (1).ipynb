        "**Type casting**  is the process of converting one data type into another. Python supports two types of type casting:\n",

        "2. **Explicit Type Casting** (Manual Conversion)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Implicit Type Casting**:\n",
        "This happens automatically when Python converts a smaller data type to a larger one. For example, when an integer is added to a float, Python automatically converts the integer to a float to ensure there’s no data loss. This process is automatic and doesn't require any manual intervention.\n",

        "print(result)    # Output: 8.14\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, `a` (an integer) is automatically converted to a float before performing the addition.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Explicit Type Casting**\n",
        "This type of conversion requires the programmer to use built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc., to convert a variable from one type to another. It’s often used when you need to manually control the type conversion, especially when moving between incompatible types.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example 1** - Converting a float to an integer:\n",
        "\n",
